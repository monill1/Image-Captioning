# Image-Captioning

- This is image captioning model using a pre-trained Vision Encoder-Decoder model. I'll be explaining how this model works and how to use it using the Python code.

- To get started, let's go over what image captioning is. Image captioning is the process of generating textual descriptions of the content of an image. This can be a useful tool for people with visual impairments, as well as for applications like automatic image tagging, image retrieval, and even autonomous driving.

- We start off by installing two packages: transformers and gradio. Transformers is a popular Python library for natural language processing, while Gradio is a web app that makes it easy to create custom interfaces for machine learning models.

- Next, we load the pre-trained model and necessary components. In this case, we're using the Vision Encoder-Decoder model that has been pre-trained on a large dataset of images and captions. We also load the ViTImageProcessor, which is used to preprocess the image data, as well as the AutoTokenizer, which is used to tokenize the text data.

- After loading the necessary components, we define a function to predict captions for images. This function takes in a list of image URLs, downloads the images using the requests library, sets the image format to RGB, and appends the images to a list. The ViTImageProcessor is then used to extract the features from the images, which are fed into the Vision Encoder-Decoder model to generate captions.

- We then define another function to generate captions for a given image. This function takes in an image, preprocesses it using the ViTImageProcessor, and generates a caption using the Vision Encoder-Decoder model and AutoTokenizer.

- Finally, we create a Gradio interface for the model, which allows us to upload an image and generate a caption for it. We set the input to an image and the output to a textbox, and provide a title and description for the interface.

- And that's it! With just a few lines of code, we can generate captions for any image using a pre-trained Vision Encoder-Decoder model. I hope you found this video helpful in understanding image captioning and how to use this model.
